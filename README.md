This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

# Info
## React-native: 0.74


## Step 1: Install the project:
### For Android and iOS

```bash
npm install
```
### For iOS only 

```bash
bundle install
npx pod-install
```

## Step 2: Run the project
### For Android (Android Studio emulator open, check all conditions are met on it)

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS
```bash
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="<emulator_name>"
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should be running the app
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it from Xcode directly.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified this React Native App. 

## Notes:
 Continuous scrolling/fetching was implemented but had no more time to fix a looping bug, probably threshold related or overall logic, so its commented out
